# Snowman

Created the game SnowMan as a Node.js Command Line App.

# How the Game Is Played:

The program random picks a word and prints a row of dashes, giving the number of letters in the word.

The guessing player now guesses a letter.

If the guessing player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the program writes it in all its correct positions. And the player does not lose a guess.

If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, the program draws one element of a snowman stick figure. And the player loses a guess.

The game is over when - the guessing player completes the word. Or the guessing player has used 5 guesses.
